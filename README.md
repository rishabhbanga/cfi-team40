PROBLEM STATEMENT
Distributed Air quality monitoring require mutiple sensors with location and data, cloud connectivity allows for analysis of 
mutiple stations and data levels to determine pollution source for example. Other uses for sensor stations like these 
include farm monitoring, for soil moisture and local weather forecasting or monitoring.

SOLUTION:
Single file to monitor many different parameters, including Temperature, Humidity, Dust concentration, Pressure, and Air Quality.

Air_Quality_Box folder contaings the actual code integrating all these above mentioned parameters, while the For Reference folder 
contains separate for each sensor used.
